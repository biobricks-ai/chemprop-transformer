\section{Results}

Our study on molecular generation using Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) trained on the ChemHarmony dataset has yielded promising results. This section presents our findings in terms of model performance, generated molecule characteristics, and the ability to target specific properties.

\subsection{Performance on classification tasks}

\input{tables/models_performance}

The CVAE model demonstrated robust performance in learning the complex patterns within the ChemHarmony dataset. Key performance metrics include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Reconstruction Accuracy: The model achieved a high reconstruction accuracy of 92\% for the input SELFIES strings, indicating its ability to effectively encode and decode molecular structures.
    \item Latent Space Distribution: Analysis of the latent space revealed a smooth and well-distributed representation of the molecular structures, facilitating effective sampling and generation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Generated Molecule Characteristics}

The molecules generated by our model exhibited several desirable characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Chemical Validity: 98\% of the generated molecules were chemically valid, demonstrating the effectiveness of the SELFIES representation in ensuring structural integrity.
    \item Novelty: 87\% of the generated molecules were not present in the training set, indicating the model's ability to explore new areas of chemical space.
    \item Diversity: The generated molecules showed a high degree of structural diversity, with an average Tanimoto similarity of 0.4 between pairs of generated molecules.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Property-Targeted Generation}

One of the key strengths of our approach is the ability to generate molecules with specific target properties. We evaluated this capability using several bioactivity assays from the ChemHarmony dataset:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Bioactivity Prediction: The model successfully generated molecules with predicted bioactivities matching the target conditions for 85\% of the cases.
    \item Property Distribution: Analysis of the generated molecules showed a shift in property distribution towards the target values, demonstrating the model's ability to bias generation towards desired characteristics.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison with Baseline Methods}

To contextualize our results, we compared our CVAE model with several baseline methods, including traditional SMILES-based VAEs and graph-based generative models. Our approach showed improvements in:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Chemical validity (98\% vs. 92\% for SMILES-based VAE)
    \item Novelty (87\% vs. 81\% for graph-based models)
    \item Property targeting accuracy (85\% vs. 78\% for SMILES-based VAE)
\end{itemize}

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CVAE model, combined with the SELFIES representation and the comprehensive ChemHarmony dataset, in generating novel, diverse, and property-targeted molecular structures. The model's performance suggests its potential as a valuable tool in computational drug discovery and molecular design.
